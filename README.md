Salary Predictor with AI Career Insights

This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates the end-to-end process of deploying a machine learning model and enhancing it with live AI-powered features. It began as a simple Python model and evolved into an interactive web app that securely calls the Google Gemini API for dynamic content generation.

Features

    Salary Prediction: Estimates a user's salary based on their years of professional experience using a linear regression model.

    Dynamic User Feedback: Provides fun, contextual messages based on the user's experience level.

    ✨ AI Career Insights (New!): After predicting a salary, users can click a button to receive personalized career advice generated by the Google Gemini API. This includes potential job titles, key skills to develop, and suggested next steps.

How It Works: A Two-Part Architecture

This project showcases a modern web architecture that separates the public-facing frontend from a secure, private backend.
Part 1: The Machine Learning Model (Offline Training)

    Training: A linear regression model was trained in Python using scikit-learn and pandas on a salary dataset.

    Extraction: The core mathematical components of the model (the slope and intercept) were extracted. This simple formula represents the "intelligence" of the model.

Part 2: The Web Application (Frontend + Secure Backend)

    Frontend (Reacting to the User):

        The user-facing website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        It uses the extracted slope and intercept to perform the initial salary calculation instantly in the browser.

    Backend (Secure API Call):

        When the user requests "Career Insights," the frontend does not call the Google Gemini API directly.

        Instead, it sends a request to a private Vercel Serverless Function (/api/get-insights).

        This serverless function, running securely on Vercel's servers, reads a secret GEMINI_API_KEY from a private environment variable.

        The function then safely calls the Gemini API, gets the career advice, and passes the response back to the frontend to be displayed to the user.

This client-server pattern is a critical security practice that prevents the secret API key from ever being exposed to the public.
